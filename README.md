![Automatisch - Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2501931/191562539-e42f6c34-03c7-4dc4-bcf9-7f9473a9c64f.png)

üßê Automatisch is a business automation tool that lets you connect different services like Twitter, Slack, and more to automate your business processes.

üí∏ Automating your workflows doesn't have to be a difficult or expensive process. You also don't need any programming knowledge to use Automatisch.

## Advantages

There are other existing solutions in the market, like Zapier and Integromat, so you might be wondering why you should use Automatisch.

‚úÖ The most significant advantage of having Automatisch is keeping your data on your own servers. Not all companies want to use an automation service in the cloud, and the current open-source or self-hosted solutions mainly focus on developers rather than a user without a technical background.

ü§ì Your contributions are vital to the development of Automatisch. As an open-source software, anyone can have an impact on how it is being developed.

üíô No vendor lock-in. If you ever decide that Automatisch is no longer helpful for your business, you can switch to any other provider, which will be easier than switching from the one cloud provider to another since you have all data and flexibility.
