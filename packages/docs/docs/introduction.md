# Introduction

:::info

Automatisch is still in development mode. We try our best not to introduce breaking changes, but be cautious until v1 is released.

:::

üßê Automatisch is a **business automation** tool. You can connect different services like Twitter, Github, Typeform, and **[more](/integrations/available-apps)** to automate your business.

üí∏ You don't need to invest time or money to automate your workflows. Programming knowledge is also **not needed** to use Automatisch.

üí• Ready for more? Use advanced features like multi-step flows, filters, formatters, and webhook support.

<!-- Let's discover **Automatisch in less than 5 minutes**. -->

## How it works?

Automatisch is a software that connects the services you use to automate workflows without building integration or hiring someone to do it for you.

For example, you can create a workflow by specifying when I have a new follower on Twitter, add this follower to the google sheet document I have created. Using this workflow, you will get a new row on the google sheet document whenever you have a new follower. This example includes only Twitter and Google Sheets as services, but it's not limited to those. You can check the list of integrations [here](/integrations/available-apps).

You need to prepare the workflow once, and it will run continuously until you stop it or the connected account gets unlinked. Depending on the service and trigger you use, the workflow runs at intervals of 15 minutes or instantly.

## Advantages

There are existing solutions in the market like Zapier and Integromat. Having those, you might be asking, "Why should I use Automatisch?".

‚úÖ The most significant advantage of having Automatisch is **keeping your data in your own servers**.

ü§ì You can contribute and have an impact on how Automatisch is being developed since it's an **open-source software**.

üíô **No vendor lock-in**. Suppose you don't think Automatisch is helpful to your business. In that case, you can switch to any other provider, which will be easier than switching from one cloud provider to another since you have all data and flexibility.

## Let's start!
